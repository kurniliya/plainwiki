# plainwiki
This is [OpenWiki](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openwiki/) modification. 
The goal is to create classic ASP wiki engine that'll support MathML and have Mediawiki look and feel.

Main differences from OpenWiki: 
* MIME type changed to application/xhtml+xml 
* proper MathML rendering by 
  * Gecko based browsers out-of-the-box (e.g. Firefox) 
  * IE with MathPlayer add-on * spam defence by reCAPTCHA support

Features in development: 
* support for Mediawiki css (partially implemented) 
* support for Mediawiki client scripts (partially implemented)

Sites using this engine: 
* [NEQwiki, the nonlinear equations encyclopedia](https://primat.mephi.ru/wiki/).
